// Description of game: 
// write a program where a person plays against a computer in a game of 
// rock paper scissors

// Pseudocode:
// create a variable called choice for user input
// create an array of 3 with the strings Rock, Paper, and Scissors

// the program asks the user for input to pick between rock, paper, and scissors and stores it 
// in the variable choice - make 1, 2, 3 the input choices for rock, paper and scissors 

// create a function so that the computer randomly chooses a number between 1 and 3 with 1 being rock and 3 being scissors 
// and store it in a variable computerChoice

// create a function that takes both choices and have conditional statements that depict each possible outcome and in each conditional return the winner
// if they tie set an else statement at the end to redo the game
//set a winner variable to false
// set a while loop that continues running the function until a winner is apparent 

let choiceString = ["","Rock", "Paper", "Scissors"]; //the first index is empty as the user choice begins at index 1
let choice = parseInt(prompt("Choose 1 for Rock, 2 for paper, and 3 for scissors."));
